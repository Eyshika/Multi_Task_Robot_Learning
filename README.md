## Dependencies

For this project a docker container was created. Please follow these steps to setup the environment (you should be in the same path as the dockerfile):

1. Build Dockerfile

    `docker build -t robomimic:v1.0 .`

2. Create container (this assumes you want to run the project on GPU and with a DISPLAY)

    ``docker run --name robomimic_env -p 8888:8888 -p 5252:5252 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v `pwd`:/project -it --env QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 --device /dev/dri --privileged --gpus all --ipc=host robomimic:v1.0``

* Ports open to work with this container are set to 5151 and 5252 if you require different ports feel free to modify them.

3. Everytime we want to run container

    `docker start robomimic_env`

    `docker exec -it robomimic_env bash`
